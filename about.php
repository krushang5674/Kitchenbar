Thirty years later, having never left the hospitality industry, he has a lot of stories to tell. Having attended Miami University in Oxford, Ohio, Omkar worked the restaurant, bar, and event scene and even ran the local Bagel Deli while earning his degree in Business Administration. From there, he joined the risk management department at McDonald's in Oak Brook, Illinois, but missed the daily fun of interacting with people.
