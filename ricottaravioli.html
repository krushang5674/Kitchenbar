<center><h2><u>Ingredients</u></h2></center>
<center><h4>

* 1/2 cup water<br>
* Ricotta Cheese Filling<br></h4>

<center><h2><u>Instruction</u></h2></center>
<center><h4>
In an electric mixer fitted with a dough hook, add eggs, 1 at a time, and mix.<br>
Continue mixing and add all the flour and water; continue mixing until it forms a ball. <br>
Sprinkle some flour on work surface, and knead the dough until elastic and smooth.<br>
Wrap the dough in plastic wrap and let it rest for about 30 minutes to allow the gluten to relax.<br>
Cut the ball of dough in half, cover and reserve the dough you are not immediately using to prevent it from drying out.<br>
Dust the counter and dough with flour. Form the dough into a rectangle and roll it through the pasta machine, 2 or 3 times, at its widest setting.<br>
Guide the sheet of dough with the palm of your hand as it emerges from the rollers. Reduce the setting and crank the dough through again, 2 or 3 times.<br>
Continue until the machine is at its narrowest setting. The dough should be paper-thin, about 1/8-inch thick.<br>
Dust the counter and dough with flour, and lay out the long sheet of pasta.<br>
Brush the top surface of dough with egg wash. Drop 1 tablespoon of cooled filling about 2 inches apart on half the sheet of pasta.<br>
Fold the unfilled half over the filling. With an espresso cup or finger, gently press out air pockets around each mound of filling and form a seal.<br>
Use a crimper to cut each pillow into squares. Check to make sure the crimped edges are well sealed before cooking.<br>
If making ravioli in advance, dust with cornmeal to prevent them from sticking.<br>
Cook the ravioli in plenty of boiling water for 10 to 15 minutes. Ravioli will float to the top when cooked so be careful not to overcrowd the pot.<br>
Lift the ravioli from water with a large strainer or slotted spoon. Plate the pasta, top with your favorite pasta sauce and grated cheese before serving.
