 <br>*4 eggs, at room temperature <br>*1 teaspoon vanilla extract <br>*2 tablespoons lemon zest

<center><h2><u>Instruction</u></h2></center>
<center><h4>
<br>Preheat oven to 375 degrees F (190 degrees C).<br> Line 30 cupcake pan cups with paper liners.<br>
Sift the self-rising flour and salt together in a bowl.<br> In another bowl, beat the unsalted butter and sugar with an electric mixer until light and fluffy.<br> Beat in the eggs one at a time, beating each egg until incorporated before adding the next.<br> Mix in the vanilla extract and lemon zest.<br>
Gently beat the flour mixture into the butter mixture, one third at a time, alternating with half the milk and half the lemon juice after each of the first 2 additions of flour.<br> Beat until just combined; do not over mix.<br>
Fill the prepared cupcake liners with batter 3/4 full, and bake in the preheated oven until a toothpick inserted in the center comes out clean, about 17 minutes.<br> Let the cupcakes cool in the pans for about 10 minutes before removing them to finish cooling on a rack.<br>
To make the icing, beat the cream in a chilled bowl with an electric mixer set on Low until the cream begins to thicken.<br> Add the confectioners' sugar and lemon juice, a little at a time, beating after each addition, until fully incorporated.<br> Increase the mixer speed to High, and beat until the icing forms soft peaks, about 5 minutes.<br> Spread on the cooled cupcakes.<br> Refrigerate leftovers.
